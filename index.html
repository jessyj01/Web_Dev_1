  <p> <b>Aesthetic: </b> <i> "Concerned with beauty or the appreciation of beauty."</i>
  <div> The word aesthetic comes from the Greek word 'aisthētikos'. This early form of the word was a combination of the Greek words 'aisthēta' meaning 'perceptible things', and 'aisthesthai' meaning 'perceive'.</div> </p>

    <h2>1. Nyctophilia </h2>
    <p>
       
        <div> <i>" • Love of darkness or night; finding relaxation and comfort in the darkness.” </i> </div>
        <div><i> " • The condition of being very happy and comfortable in the dark:
         Nyctophilia is a condition that makes you want to sit in the dark all by yourself late at night, wide awake."</i></div>
       
 Nyctophilia is better described as a disorder. If you are a normal person that finds peace a sitting in the darkness, you are probably not a Nyctophiliac. Nyctophiliacs feel a sense of psychological relief, similar to a person who has OCD finds relief performing an obsessional ritual, rather than a sense of peace. Many people may enjoy the peace and solitude of darkness, allowing them to think or meditate.

    <p>
      <div> <i> • "Desiring or seeking powerful change in your life, behavior or a certain situation."</i></div>
      The word “Nova” originates from the Latin “Novus” meaning “New“. “Novaturient” thus should remind you of someone who wants a new life!

    <p>
      <div> <i> • "involving or displaying much industry or effort."</i></div>
      <div> <i> • "done with or involving much labor; TEDIOUS."</i></div>
        Operose comes from the Latin operosus (meaning "laborious," "industrious," or "painstaking"). That word combines the noun "oper-," which means "work," with "-osus," the Latin equivalent of the English "-ose" and "-ous" meaning "full of" or "abounding in." In its earliest uses, the word was used to describe people who are industrious or painstaking in their efforts.

      <div> <i> •"A mystical force present in all people that empowers them to affect the world or to effect chages in their own lives"</i></div>
      Orenda /ˈɔːrɛndə/ is the Iroquois name for a supposed spiritual energy inherent in people and their environment. It's an "extraordinary invisible power believed by the Iroquois Native Americans to pervade in varying degrees in all animate and inanimate natural objects as a transmissible spiritual energy capable of being exerted according to the will of its possessor."
